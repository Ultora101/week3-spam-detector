# Spam Detection Analysis Report

## How My Model Learns

### Features I Used

1. **Word Count**: The word count would be different because they would probably be trying to grab your attention and as fast as possible.
2. **Exclamation Marks**: Exclamation marks are used because of the want to create urgancy and excitement.
3. **Money Words**: These are words that would entise you to take action in thought of the user gaining bennefit.
4. **ALL CAPS**: This is again to try and gain attention of the user and also cause urgancy.

## Training Results

- Training Accuracy: 100%
- Testing Accuracy: 100%

### What This Means

This tells me that the model has been trained to look at different emails and attributes within them and make judgements based on the criteria that we set. We also can now send through more emails that the model should be able to catch the spam and nonspam emails.

## Preventing Overfitting

In the code we used a train/test split. This would show if the model performs well on training but bad in the testing stages. Another thing that we used was keeping the feature set small and within scope. This allows us to be targeted with our judgements which will cause for low errors.

## Real-World Application

If this was used by Gmail:

- Strengths: good at spam detection, fast
- Weaknesses: could be suseptable to things that are not in the paramaters, also may need some better code for larger structures
- Improvements needed: refine the "money words" so that we can add to them if the scams start to change

## What I Learned

I learned that there is a lot more to AI than I orrigonally thought. I also thought machine learning would be a lot less complicated. This just proves to me that I have a lot more to learn and it gets me excited for future stuff.
